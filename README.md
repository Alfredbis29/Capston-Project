# Capston-Project

**Project requirements**

- I personalize the content of your page. Choose a topic that is different than the one in the original design.
- 
- I follow these [design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015), including:

**Colors.**

- Typography: font face, size, and weight.
- Layout: composition and space between elements.
- The pages look almost identical to the original design. 
`
 **I Applied CSS framework (for example Bootstrap) for styling my capstone project.**`
 **I build only these 2 pages:**

- The home page.
- The about page.

**All those two pages are identic to both Version Mobile and Desktop:**

-  For Mobile: up to 768px wide.
- For Desktop: 768px or wider.

Interactions

**Links**

- The home page  has a link in the menu to the about page.
- The logo in the header links to the home page.

**Mobile menu**

- When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
- There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
- The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
- Dynamic page
- 
- The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
- You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
